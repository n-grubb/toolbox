# Noah's Frontend Toolbox
#### A personal component, style & utility library.

### Goal: A component/week in 2020
#### Components: 2 / Weeks remaining: 44

In 2020, my goal is to add atleast one component or utility function per week to this project. 
I aim to implement my own versions of common components that provide convenient yet minimal style defaults 
and are built with accessibility concerns in mind. Vue 3 accomplishes a goal of continue Vue learning (we use Vue at Blackfynn).
I contemplated writing components as web components in vanilla js but the DX is suboptimal. While I would prefer to use a native tech
and to be framework agnostic, this is a personal tool and I'm likely to always grab Vue as my tool of choice. 

- TODO: Port all of my components over here.
- TODO: Use TypeScript?
- TODO: Add Cypress test examples?
- TODO: write readme/blog post explaining project
- TODO: configure doc site deploy to Netlify
