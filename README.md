### A component library designed to be simple & accessible, with convenient styling defaults.

- **Simply semantic**: Most component libraries are designed to handle every use case (which is great!) but the html output tends to turn into a bowl of <div> soup. This component library is different: it is designed to generate semantic html and takes advantage of advanced CSS techniques to keep the markdown lean.
- **Accessible**: Components will be developed with accessibility in mind and feature convenient defaults and properties around a11y. 
- **Convenient Default Styles**: Included in this project is a CSS system that takes advantage of CSS Custom Properties to create convenient defaults that are easily overwritten by a theme system. This is an opinionated use that takes some inspiration from Tailwind's design tokens without the utility-first approach.

_Warning: This component library is designed for personal use and is very much a work-in-progress. I plan to continue to contribute to it and get it in a working state as I find time._

**UPDATE**: I'm currently working on expanding this with Yarn workspaces to deliver Vue & React versions of each component as well as a shared library of utilities of mixins. To view other planned components check out the Project tab to see a roadmap kanban board. The evolution of this will occur [here](https://github.com/n-grubb/qm).
